LittleSteps - Newborn Baby Care Services Website
 
LittleSteps is a web-based platform that provides newborn baby care services for parents. The website allows parents to easily explore services such as newborn baths, baby massages, mother care support, sleep routine assistance, and hygiene care.

Using a simple and intuitive booking form, parents can schedule services by entering details such as the baby’s age, preferred date and time, and contact information. The platform stores booking data securely using LocalStorage, provides booking confirmation messages, and includes a read-only admin page to view all booking requests.

Designed with a responsive layout, LittleSteps ensures a smooth experience across both desktop and mobile devices, making newborn care management easier for busy parents.

This project focuses on strong frontend fundamentals, including form handling, input validation and browser-based data storage.
It demonstrates the practical use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a real-world service booking application.
